## Women Who Code Manila - React Study Group

The React study group is held every third Saturday of the month. Please check our [MeetUp Page](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Manila/) for updates. 

#### What is React?
React is a Javascript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces. 

*Why React?*
* Everything is made of components which have a well-defined life cycle
* React uses JSX which allows writing HTML with Javascript
* VirtualDOM makes react faster ([watch "The Story of Virtual DOM" here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYbgopx44vo))
